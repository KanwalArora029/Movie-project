While its duration and pacing may cause one to add a few sit-ins to complete the film, it&#39;s still glued tightly by such magnanimous performances from DeNiro, Pacino and Pesci. 4.1/5</div>\\n                    </div>\\n                    <div class=\"mop-audience-reviews__review--user-wrap\">\\n                        \\n                            <a href=\"/user/id/836515740\">\\n                            \\n                                <span class=\"mop-audience-reviews__review--user-default\"></span>\\n                            \\n                            </a>\\n                        \\n                        <div class=\"mop-audience-reviews__review--name-wrap\">\\n                            \\n                                <a href=\"/user/id/836515740\">\\n                                    <span class=\"mop-audience-reviews__review--name\">Eugene B</span>\\n                                </a>\\n                            \\n                            \\n                                <strong class=\"super-reviewer-badge\">Super Reviewer</strong>\\n                            \\n                        </div>\\n                    </div>\\n                </li>\\n                \\n                <li class=\"mop-audience-reviews__review-item pull-right cr\">\\n                    <div class=\"mop-audience-reviews__review-quote\">\\n                        <div class=\" clearfix\">\\n                            \\n                                <span class=\"star-display\"><span class=\"star-display__filled \"></span><span class=\"star-display__filled \"></span><span class=\"star-display__filled \"></span><span class=\"star-display__filled \"></span><span class=\"star-display__filled \"></span></span>\\n                            \\n                            <span class=\"mop-audience-reviews__review--duration\">Dec 01, 2019</span>\\n                        </div>\\n                        \\n                        <div class=\"mop-audience-reviews__review--comment clamp clamp-4 js-clamp\">It&#39;s definitely worth the hype, and definitely worth the 3 1/2 hours of viewing time. Set against the backdrop of the industrial Mid-Atlantic during some of the country&#39;s most turbulent political and social events, The Irishman is 2019&#39;s first perfect film - one that is so good, it doesn&#39;t even feel like it belongs in this decade, but rather feels like a masterpiece unearthed from decades earlier. De Niro, Pacino, Pesci are everything you want them to be and more in their performances; the writing, pacing, and editing are tight; the humor is dark, fast, and intelligent; and the story unravels beautifully . While the running time may require patience and dedication, there truly is no wasted moment - no extraneous or lagging scenes - as everything fits together seamlessly to deliver a payoff that is truly worth it.</div>\\n                    </div>\\n                    <div class=\"mop-audience-reviews__review--user-wrap\">\\n                        \\n                            <a href=\"/user/id/896467979\">\\n                            \\n                                <img class=\"mop-audience-reviews__review--user-avatar\" src=\"https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/100000293612769/picture\"></span>\\n                            \\n                            </a>\\n                        \\n                        <div class=\"mop-audience-reviews__review--name-wrap\">\\n                            \\n                                <a href=\"/user/id/896467979\">\\n                                    <span class=\"mop-audience-reviews__review--name\">Matthew S</span>\\n                                </a>\\n                            \\n                            \\n                                <strong class=\"super-reviewer-badge\">Super Reviewer</strong>\\n                            \\n                        </div>\\n                    </div>\\n                </li>\\n                \\n                <li class=\"mop-audience-reviews__review-item pull-left cl\">\\n                    <div class=\"mop-audience-reviews__review-quote\">\\n                        <div class=\" clearfix\">\\n                            \\n                                <span class=\"star-display\"><span class=\"star-display__filled \"></span><span class=\"star-display__filled \"></span><span class=\"star-display__filled \"></span><span class=\"star-display__filled \"></span><span class=\"star-display__filled \"></span></span>\\n                            \\n                            <span class=\"mop-audience-reviews__review--duration\">Nov 29, 2019</span>\\n                        </div>\\n                        \\n                        <div class=\"mop-audience-reviews__review--comment clamp clamp-4 js-clamp\">It&#39;s long like &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot;, but it&#39;s also just as good.

Set against the backdrop of the industrial Mid-Atlantic during some of the country's most turbulent political and social events, The Irishman is 2019's first perfect film - one that is so good, it doesn't even feel like it belongs in this decade, but rather feels like a masterpiece unearthed from decades earlier. De Niro, Pacino, Pesci are everything you want them to be and more in their performances; the writing, pacing, and editing are tight; the humor is dark, fast, and intelligent; and the story unravels beautifully . While the running time may require patience and dedication, there truly is no wasted moment - no extraneous or lagging scenes - as everything fits together seamlessly to deliver a payoff that is truly worth it.</div>\n",

      "     It's definitely worth the hype, and definitely worth the 3 1/2 hours of viewing time. Set against the backdrop of the industrial Mid-Atlantic during some of the country's most turbulent political and social events, The Irishman is 2019's first perfect film - one that is so good, it doesn't even feel like it belongs in this decade, but rather feels like a masterpiece unearthed from decades earlier. De Niro, Pacino, Pesci are everything you want them to be and more in their performances; the writing, pacing, and editing are tight; the humor is dark, fast, and intelligent; and the story unravels beautifully . While the running time may require patience and dedication, there truly is no wasted moment - no extraneous or lagging scenes - as everything fits together seamlessly to deliver a payoff that is truly worth it.\n",

Now, Francis Ford Coppola\\'s extraordinary film is brought to vivid new life in The Cotton Club Encore. Featuring never-before-seen scenes and musical sequences that deepen and enrich the storylines, this remastered and beautifully restored version represents Coppola\\'s fully realized vision of the film. Though the public\\'s understanding of the film is an American crime drama centered around Richard Gere, Coppola meant for it to be a story of two main characters, one white and one black, navigating life in and around the Cotton Club with their families. However, back in 1984 during post-production, the film was condemned as too long, and according to some stakeholders as having \\\\\"too many black people,\\\\\" and \\\\\"too much tap dancing,\\\\\" Coppola was pressured to minimize Gregory Hines\\' character and lose many musical numbers, thus eroding the historical portrayal of what the performances at the Cotton Club shows were really like. Along with his team at American Zoetrope, Coppola set out to create an updated version that would more closely resemble the original intentions of the film. This new version of the film, shown only three times previously during the 2017 Telluride Film Festival, features additional scenes such as an extended Gregory Hines and Maurice Hines tap performance, Lonette McKee\\'s brilliant rendition of Ethel Waters\\' \\\\\"Stormy Weather,\\\\\" Coppola\\'s originally envisioned ending, and more.\",\"synopsisType\":\"synopsis\",\"runtime\":\"2 hr. 19 min.\",\"posters\":{\"thumborId\":\"v1.bTsxMzE5NjQyMztqOzE4Mjg3OzEyMDA7MjY5ODs0MDAw\",\"primary\":\"https://resizing.flixster.com/4szHBuWbb5KSAUJZLWLm6nDG2v4=/130x0/v1.bTsxMzE5NjQyMztqOzE4Mjg3OzEyMDA7MjY5ODs0MDAw\"},\"actors\":[\"Richard Gere\", \"Gregory Hines\", \"Diane Lane\"]},{\"id\":771514346,\"title\":\"QT8: The First Eight\",\"url\":\"/m/qt8_the_first_eight\",\"tomatoIcon\":\"fresh\",\"tomatoScore\":88,\"theaterReleaseDate\":\"Oct 21\",\"dvdReleaseDate\":\"Dec 3\",\"mpaaRating\":\"NR\",\"synopsis\":\"QT8: The First Eight is the next film in the 21 Years series following 21 Years: Richard Linklater.

Now, Francis Ford Coppola's extraordinary film is brought to vivid new life in The Cotton Club Encore. Featuring never-before-seen scenes and musical sequences that deepen and enrich the storylines, this remastered and beautifully restored version represents Coppola's fully realized vision of the film. Though the public's understanding of the film is an American crime drama centered around Richard Gere, Coppola meant for it to be a story of two main characters, one white and one black, navigating life in and around the Cotton Club with their families. However, back in 1984 during post-production, the film was condemned as too long, and according to some stakeholders as having \\\"too many black people,\\\" and \\\"too much tap dancing,\\\" Coppola was pressured to minimize Gregory Hines' character and lose many musical numbers, thus eroding the historical portrayal of what the performances at the Cotton Club shows were really like. Along with his team at American Zoetrope, Coppola set out to create an updated version that would more closely resemble the original intentions of the film. This new version of the film, shown only three times previously during the 2017 Telluride Film Festival, features additional scenes such as an extended Gregory Hines and Maurice Hines tap performance, Lonette McKee's brilliant rendition of Ethel Waters' \\\"Stormy Weather,\\\" Coppola's originally envisioned ending, and more.\",\"synopsisType\":\"synopsis\",\"runtime\":\"2 hr. 19 min.\",\"posters\":{\"thumborId\":\"v1.bTsxMzE5NjQyMztqOzE4Mjg3OzEyMDA7MjY5ODs0MDAw\",\"primary\":\"https://resizing.flixster.com/4szHBuWbb5KSAUJZLWLm6nDG2v4=/130x0/v1.bTsxMzE5NjQyMztqOzE4Mjg3OzEyMDA7MjY5ODs0MDAw\"},\"actors\":[\"Richard Gere\", \"Gregory Hines\", \"Diane Lane\"]},{\"id\":771514346,\"title\":\"QT8: The First Eight\",\"url\":\"/m/qt8_the_first_eight\",\"tomatoIcon\":\"fresh\",\"tomatoScore\":88,\"theaterReleaseDate\":\"Oct 21\",\"dvdReleaseDate\":\"Dec 3\",\"mpaaRating\":\"NR\",\"synopsis\":\"QT8: The First Eight is the next film in the 21 Years series following 21 Years: Richard Linklater.

Now, Francis Ford Coppola's extraordinary film is brought to vivid new life in The Cotton Club Encore. Featuring never-before-seen scenes and musical sequences that deepen and enrich the storylines, this remastered and beautifully restored version represents Coppola's fully realized vision of the film. Though the public's understanding of the film is an American crime drama centered around Richard Gere, Coppola meant for it to be a story of two main characters, one white and one black, navigating life in and around the Cotton Club with their families. However, back in 1984 during post-production, the film was condemned as too long, and according to some stakeholders as having \\\"too many black people,\\\" and \\\"too much tap dancing,\\\" Coppola was pressured to minimize Gregory Hines' character and lose many musical numbers, thus eroding the historical portrayal of what the performances at the Cotton Club shows were really like. Along with his team at American Zoetrope, Coppola set out to create an updated version that would more closely resemble the original intentions of the film. This new version of the film, shown only three times previously during the 2017 Telluride Film Festival, features additional scenes such as an extended Gregory Hines and Maurice Hines tap performance, Lonette McKee's brilliant rendition of Ethel Waters' \\\"Stormy Weather,\\\" Coppola's originally envisioned ending, and more.\",\"synopsisType\":\"synopsis\",\"runtime\":\"2 hr. 19 min.\",\"posters\":{\"thumborId\":\"v1.bTsxMzE5NjQyMztqOzE4Mjg3OzEyMDA7MjY5ODs0MDAw\",\"primary\":\"https://resizing.flixster.com/4szHBuWbb5KSAUJZLWLm6nDG2v4=/130x0/v1.bTsxMzE5NjQyMztqOzE4Mjg3OzEyMDA7MjY5ODs0MDAw\"},\"actors\":[\"Richard Gere\", \"Gregory Hines\", \"Diane Lane\"]},{\"id\":771514346,\"title\":\"QT8: The First Eight\",\"url\":\"/m/qt8_the_first_eight\",\"tomatoIcon\":\"fresh\",\"tomatoScore\":88,\"theaterReleaseDate\":\"Oct 21\",\"dvdReleaseDate\":\"Dec 3\",\"mpaaRating\":\"NR\",\"synopsis\":\"QT8: The First Eight is the next film in the 21 Years series following 21 Years: Richard Linklater.

Featuring never-before-seen scenes and musical sequences that deepen and enrich the storylines, this remastered and beautifully restored version represents Coppola's fully realized vision of the film. Though the public's understanding of the film is an American crime drama centered around Richard Gere, Coppola meant for it to be a story of two main characters, one white and one black, navigating life in and around the Cotton Club with their families. However, back in 1984 during post-production, the film was condemned as too long, and according to some stakeholders as having \\\"too many black people,\\\" and \\\"too much tap dancing,\\\" Coppola was pressured to minimize Gregory Hines' character and lose many musical numbers, thus eroding the historical portrayal of what the performances at the Cotton Club shows were really like. Along with his team at American Zoetrope, Coppola set out to create an updated version that would more closely resemble the original intentions of the film. This new version of the film, shown only three times previously during the 2017 Telluride Film Festival, features additional scenes such as an extended Gregory Hines and Maurice Hines tap performance, Lonette McKee's brilliant rendition of Ethel Waters' \\\"Stormy Weather,\\\" Coppola's originally envisioned ending, and more.\",\"synopsisType\":\"synopsis\",\"runtime\":\"2 hr. 19 min.\",\"posters\":{\"thumborId\":\"v1.bTsxMzE5NjQyMztqOzE4Mjg3OzEyMDA7MjY5ODs0MDAw\",\"primary\":\"https://resizing.flixster.com/4szHBuWbb5KSAUJZLWLm6nDG2v4=/130x0/v1.bTsxMzE5NjQyMztqOzE4Mjg3OzEyMDA7MjY5ODs0MDAw\"},\"actors\":[\"Richard Gere\", \"Gregory Hines\", \"Diane Lane\"]},{\"id\":771514346,\"title\":\"QT8: The First Eight\",\"url\":\"/m/qt8_the_first_eight\",\"tomatoIcon\":\"fresh\",\"tomatoScore\":88,\"theaterReleaseDate\":\"Oct 21\",\"dvdReleaseDate\":\"Dec 3\",\"mpaaRating\":\"NR\",\"synopsis\":\"QT8: The First Eight is the next film in the 21 Years series following 21 Years: Richard Linklater.
